DyTech
======

DyTech is a mod for factorio, and a total conversion

You can look into the code here, and if you see something unbalanced, or a bug (or seen 1 ingame) make a pull request or create an issue on git with a detailed description.

The following repository was created from [Valerates/CORE-DyTech-Core](https://github.com/Valerate/CORE-DyTech-Core) instead of [Dysoch/DyTech](https://github.com/Dysoch/DyTech), because the first repository was used to create the lastes 'zip' file on the mod portal. 

The main goal of this repository is to refactor the mods source with the following changes:
- Mainly reindenting the source code (indentation sucks at this moment...)
- Fixing bugs that are going to appear during the refactoring process
- Making the mod API more flexible and much easier to extend 
- Ensure the same naming convention in all files and sub-mods
- Improving the code itself 
- Many more...

WARNING:
